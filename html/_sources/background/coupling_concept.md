# Coupling concept


One basic problem when dealing with regional climate models system is that the individual components (atmosphere, ocean, land etc.) 
are described by different models (realized as computer programs) that act on different grids, see  {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-grids>` and \Fig{fig:grids1D}.

Still, the components have to be coupled in order communicate their state to each other and exchange fluxes as given by nature itself.
